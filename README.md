# Mock_EyeCare_Procurement_Insights

### Data Source
This project uses mock data generated to simulate procurement spending in a cataract surgery setting. You can find the data generation code [here](https://github.com/BWellLabs/Mock_EyeCare_Procurement_Insights/blob/main/Eye%20Data%20Creation%20Script.ipynb) to create similar mock datasets.

### Note
The dataset is not real and was created using a combination of predefined parameters and random sampling. It is intended solely for demonstration purposes.
